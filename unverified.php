        <h1>Verification Error</h1>

        <p>
            The previous signup attempt encountered an error during verification.  This means that we cannot be 100%
          sure if the signup was successful or not.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can try contacting us or <a href="index.php">signing up</a> again.
